# TITLE : Human Detection to Mitigate Excessive Electrical Energy 
# Usage in Communal Spaces
# Abstract
The study aims to delve deeply into the escalating issue of electrical energy consumption within 
communal settings, particularly focusing on high-traffic areas such as restrooms and 
multiplexes. These locations serve as crucial hubs of human activity, but their energy 
consumption patterns often go unchecked, leading to significant financial burdens for both users 
and facility operators. Moreover, the unchecked energy usage exacerbates strain on already 
burdened energy grids, resulting in heightened carbon emissions and exacerbating 
environmental concerns such as climate change. 
To address this pressing issue, the study proposes a novel approach leveraging the TensorFlow 
Object Counting API. This innovative strategy seeks to develop a sophisticated system capable 
of accurately and efficiently counting human subjects in real-time within these communal 
spaces. By precisely identifying and tallying the number of occupants present, the system aims 
to curtail unnecessary electricity consumption, thereby mitigating the financial and 
environmental impacts associated with excessive energy usage. 
The proposed system is underpinned by the robust capabilities of the TensorFlow platform, 
offering a versatile and user-friendly framework for developing advanced object counting 
systems. Through intricate algorithms and state-of-the-art technology, the system demonstrates 
remarkable proficiency in item identification, tracking, and counting, showcasing its 
adaptability and resilience in addressing complex challenges. 
By tackling the dual challenges of rising electricity bills and environmental degradation, the 
proposed technology presents a promising solution to the problem at hand. Through meticulous 
research and analysis, the study seeks to elucidate the underlying factors contributing to 
excessive energy consumption in communal settings. Furthermore, it aims to propose practical 
and actionable solutions to effectively manage and mitigate energy wastage. 
Ultimately, the overarching goal of the study is to implement measures that promote sustainable 
resource management and environmental conservation in communal spaces. By optimizing 
energy usage and fostering a culture of efficiency, the study endeavors to contribute to the 
collective efforts aimed at building a more sustainable and environmentally conscious society.
